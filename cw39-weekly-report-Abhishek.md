Week 26. - 30. 09.2022

Monday 
- Day off

Tuesday
- Began some work to update the leg simulation models to allow for toe-off
- Planning for travel to Aachen 

Wednesday 
- Continue work on the leg model
- Travel to Aachen 

Thursday & Friday 
- Attended workshop in Aachen 
    - Met Raul Fuentes, Itai Einav (U. Sydney) and Ken Kamrin (MIT)
    - Learned about several geomechanics models for sand/soils simulation: SPM, MPM, and RFT
    - Explained the birdbot leg design 
    - Discussed a possible collaboration direction: using geomechanics models for optimizing the leg design (passive control) parameter and possibly using RFT (reduced-order model) for active control.
