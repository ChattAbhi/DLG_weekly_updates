Week of 31.10.2022 - 04.11.2022

Monday
- Work on preparing the 2-seg simulation model for matching experimental data. 
- Simulation CoP does not move a lot in simulation

Tuesday 
- Holiday

Wedenesday
- Looked for 2 Segment experiments to match; could not find an experiment without toe-off or foot arching
- Imported 2-seg measured CoP data to matlab; comparison did nor show good match. The 2-seg CoP measurement appear very similar to the 1-seg measured CoP data.

Thursday 
- Work on the project plan; update timeline, made Gantt chart 
- Updated some steps on the project

Friday 
- Work on detailed plans for the simulation part of the project, in collaboration with Raul's group.
