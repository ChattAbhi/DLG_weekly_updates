Week of 21 - 25.10.2022

Monday
- Building leg inside OpenSim

Tuesday
- Constructed the biarticular spring in opensim
- Had a meeting with Kemal from RWTH Aachen: They are building a solo-leg (using the Morti design) and boom setup for an experiment. They don't have certain components and so were asking if we have any spare that we may ship to them. I checked that we have some spare, and told them to ask you about this; so they might email you. 

Wednesday
- Continue working on the birdbot-type biped model inside opensim. The basic structure of the model is mostly complete, but still need to work on adding the spring-tendons.
- Notified HR and Director about my departure on Jan 31, 2023.
