Week of 17 - 21.10.2022

Monday
- Worked on comparing force-plate CoP data with the simulation CoP data for 1-seg foot 
- The overall behavior appear very similar, but there seems to be some scale difference. In particular, the experimental CoP trajectory seems to have a length larger than the foot segment, which means there might be a scale on the force-plate data, but need to make sure.

Tuesday 
- The force-plate measured CoP range being larger than the foot segment length, looked into the video to find that in all cases part of the ankle segment touching the substrate.
- Measured the portion of the ankle touching the base and decided to add that to the foot-segment length, as a correction. This correction brought the corrected foot segment length closer to the measured CoP range, but the measured range remained approximately 11-12mm larger than the foot-segment length.

Wedenesday
- Used the corrected foot segment length in simulation to compare the simulated versus measured CoP 
- Organized the result on the shared one-note
