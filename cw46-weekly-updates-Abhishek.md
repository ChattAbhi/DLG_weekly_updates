Week of 14 - 18.10.2022

Monday
- Searched and looked into John Hutchinson papers related using OpenSim for dinosaur leg modeling

Tuesday
- Installed OpenSim and went through some tutorials
- Tried to find some papers related to walking vs. running mid-stance leg angles

Wednesday
- Went through some tutorials and examples on the matlab api for OpenSim 
- The contact model OpenSim uses is Hunt-Crossley, which is for spherical contacts. There are also a few other models, but they are all spherical.

Thursday
- Studied a bit more how contacts are modeled in OpenSim; couldn't figure out a way to use our own contact model for the soft substrate.
- Researched for any alternative methods for specifying the contact force function on OpenSim via the matlab api.

Friday
- Discussed with Bernadette about the ways in which we may input our own RFT type contact model and also how to easily build models without writing XML files.
- OpenSim creator can be used to very easilty create birdbot model
- It is still a bit unclear how to custom create contact model in OpenSim. One possible option is to define the ground reaction force directly: Need to explore a bit more.
