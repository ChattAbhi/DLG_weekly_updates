Week of 02.01.2023 - 06.01.2023

Monday
- Built the second leg into the birdbot type biped model in OpenSim
- Had some trouble connecting the second leg to the trunk.

Tuesday & Wednesday
- Several failed attempts on connecting the second leg to the Trunk using a pin-joint
- Looked for any buit-in method for specifying joint-limits into the model; couldn't find any. Joint limits are required for the hard-stops present on the birdbot foot-joints, and also for movement restrictions on the biarticular springs.

Thursday
- Indirectly implemented joint-limits to the foot joint by attaching contact-spheres on the foot and tarso to limit movement 

Friday
Holiday
